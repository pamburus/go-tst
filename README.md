# go-tst
A lightweight go test framework built on top of stdlib's `testing` package.

Inspired by [gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) library but comparing to it has more convenient way of handling multiple return values in assertions and is intended to be used in cases when having a lot of dependencies is not desired.
